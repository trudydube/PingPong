# PingPong
I built a ping pong game using AI by entering prompts into chatGPT.

## Running the Game
In order to run the game, all you have to do is download the src folder, and then open the index.html file by double clicking it.
The game will automatically begin.

## How to Play
Goal: The goal is to not let the ball get past the player's side of the screen. Block the ball by positioning the paddle in front of it. The first to 5 points between the player and the AI wins.

Controls: Use the up and down arrow keys to move the paddle up and down.
